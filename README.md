# DOMTree Explorer+

A Chrome extension for visualizing, exploring, and annotating the DOM tree of any web page. Designed for both developers and non-developers, with a modern, user-friendly UI.

## Features

- **DOM Tree Visualization**: Explore the structure of any web page in a clean, expandable tree view.
- **Element Highlighting**: Click any node to highlight the corresponding element on the page.
